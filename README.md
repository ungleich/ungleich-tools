Hello hacker!

The tools used in this repository are used by the team of ungleich
(www.ungleich.ch) to maintain servers and data centers.

A special data center that we maintain and that most tools are written
for is the Data Center Light (www.datacenterlight.ch).

As we are truly dedicated and committed to open source, we are trying
to release *everything* open source that we can (even if not
everything is yet directly usable by others).

Feel free to clone, use, distribute the code according to GPLv3+
licensing.

Best,

team ungleich

p.s.: Some stuff that you (will) find in this repo:

- Tools to manage ceph cluster(s)
- Tools to manage opennebula cluster(s)
